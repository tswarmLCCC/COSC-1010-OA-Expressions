# PRIMM: Modify Activity
#
# Instructions: Here is a program that converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
# For each modification below, first predict the outcome in the comments,
# then make the change to the code and run it to verify your prediction.

# --- Original Code ---
celsius = 25
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32

print(f"{celsius} degrees Celsius is equal to {fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit.")


# --- Modification 1 ---
# Change the formula to convert from a starting `fahrenheit` value of 77 to `celsius`.
# The formula for that is `(fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`.
#
# Prediction:
# Verified Result: (What does the program print?)


# --- Modification 2 ---
# Go back to the original code. Change the `celsius` variable to `25.5`.
#
# Prediction: What will the new Fahrenheit value be? Will the data type of the `fahrenheit` variable change?
# Verified Result:


# --- Modification 3 ---
# Go back to the original code. Try to "break" the program by changing the calculation
# to `fahrenheit = (celsius * "9/5") + 32`. Notice the quotes around `9/5`.
#
# Prediction: What kind of error do you think this will cause and why?
# Verified Result:
