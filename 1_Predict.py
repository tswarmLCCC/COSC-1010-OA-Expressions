# PRIMM: Predict Activity
#
# Instructions: Read the following Python code snippet. Without running it,
# predict the final value and data type for the variables `result_1` and `result_2`.
# Write down your prediction and your reasoning in the comments below.

# Variables for calculation
num_items = 15
price_per_item = 4.50
shipping_cost = 10

# Calculate the results
result_1 = num_items * price_per_item + shipping_cost
result_2 = num_items * (price_per_item + shipping_cost)

# --- Your Prediction ---

# `result_1` Value:
# `result_1` Data Type:
# Reasoning:

# PRIMM: Predict Activity
#
# Instructions: Read the following Python code snippet. Without running it,
# predict the final value for the variables `minutes` and `seconds`.
# Write down your prediction and a brief explanation in the comments below.

# A total duration in seconds
total_seconds = 395

# Convert to minutes and seconds
minutes = total_seconds // 60
seconds = total_seconds % 60

# --- Your Prediction ---

# `minutes` Value:
# `seconds` Value:
# Reasoning:
